Description: Dependency-free, ultra fast calculation of geodesic areas, using
    the the reference nanometre-accuracy libraries of Karney (2013)
    <doi:10.1007/s00190-012-0578-z>, as used by the 'sf' package. The main
    function accepts a single input of two columns containing the longitude and
    latitude coordinates, assumed to be a polygon and represented in WSG84
    projection, and returns the area in square metres, and perimeter in metres.
